# Cross-Platform To-Do List App

## Framework Used:
Flutter (Dart programming language).

## Native VS Cross-Platform Explanation:
Native development uses platform-specific languages such as Kotlin/Java for Android and Swift for iOS, giving full access to device features. While Cross-platform development allows a single codebase to run on multiple platforms, reducing development time and maintenance while maintaining consistent UI.

## App Features:

- **Delete tasks:** - Users can remove tasks using the delete button/icon.
